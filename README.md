# Virtual Assistant - Adaptive Decision Boundary
Open Intent Detection - ADB

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate the approach proposed in the Github "Adaptive Decision Boundary" by Zhang [1]. The approach aims to improve the performance of open intent classification, a challenging task in dialogue systems, thus balancing the identification of known intents and the detection of unknown intents by learning an adaptive decision boundary (ADB).
